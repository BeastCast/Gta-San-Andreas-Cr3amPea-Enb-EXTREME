 BASIC INFO:

  This mod is a part of adding ultimate graphics to dated games.
  
  This is an enb graphics mod for the definitive edition and 1.0 original version of GTA San Andreas.
  
  (THE GTA SA DEFINITIVE EDITION COMPATIBLE VERSION OF THIS MOD IS NOT QUITE READY YET, GIVE IT TIME).
  
  This uses enb V .430 which tries it's hardest to prevent bugs.
 
 I am going to try my hardest to update this mod somewhat frequently.
 I've worked for months on this mod and it is hopefully getting close to perfection.

  I will be making a version of this mod for Gta vc, Gta 3, and the definitive versions of the original gta games.
  (The CreamPea gta 4 enb preset is on the way.)

 COMPATIBILITY:
 *There will be a new version of this mod made for the trilogy of Gta Sa.
 
 -This is mainly compatible with 1.0 version of GTA SA. It has not been tested on any other versions by me.
 
 -All requirements will be included with the mod; meaning that the mod will be big to install.
